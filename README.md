# JAWS - Social Day Cruising Program Management System

JAWS is a front-end website and REST API for managing the Social Day Cruising program at Nepean Sailing Club. It handles boat fleet management, crew registration, and intelligent assignment of crew members to boats for seasonal sailing events using sophisticated optimization algorithms.

## Quick Start

Get up and running in 5 steps:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
composer install

# 2. Initialize database
vendor/bin/phinx migrate

# 3. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set JWT_SECRET (minimum 32 characters)

# 4. Start development server
php -S localhost:8000 -t public

# 5. Test the API
curl http://localhost:8000/api/events
```

## Key Features

**Intelligent Crew Assignment**
- Multi-dimensional ranking system for boats and crews
- Constraint-based optimization algorithm
- Deterministic behavior ensures reproducible results

**Flexible Registration**
- Boat owners register boats with capacity and requirements
- Crew members register with skill level and preferences
- "Flex" members can be both boat owners and crew

**Automated Matching**
- Capacity matching handles three scenarios (too few crews, too many crews, perfect fit)
- Assignment optimization minimizes six rule violations (ASSIST, WHITELIST, HIGH_SKILL, LOW_SKILL, PARTNER, REPEAT)
- Real-time updates after every registration change

**Smart Features**
- Blackout windows prevent changes during event hours
- History tracking adjusts rankings based on past participation
- Partner preferences keep requested partnerships together
- Skill distribution balances experience across boats

## Technology Stack

- **Database:** SQLite with Phinx migrations

## Architecture

JAWS follows **Clean Architecture** with strict dependency rules. Dependencies point inward, from outer to inner layers:

```
Presentation → Infrastructure → Application → Domain
  (HTTP)      (Database/AWS)   (Use Cases)   (Business Logic)
```

### The Four Layers

**Domain Layer** (`src/Domain/`)
- Core business logic and rules
- **NO** external dependencies (pure PHP)
- Contains: Entities, Value Objects, Enums, Domain Services, Collections

**Application Layer** (`src/Application/`)
- Use cases and application orchestration
- Depends on: Domain layer only
- Contains: Use Cases, Ports (interfaces), DTOs, Exceptions

**Infrastructure Layer** (`src/Infrastructure/`)
- External service adapters
- Depends on: Application + Domain layers
- Contains: Repositories (SQLite), Email Service (PHPMailer/SMTP), Calendar Service, Time Service

**Presentation Layer** (`src/Presentation/`)
- HTTP/REST API
- Depends on: Application layer
- Contains: Controllers, Middleware, Router, Response formatters

### Why Clean Architecture?

- **Testability**: Unit test business logic without database or HTTP
- **Flexibility**: Swap SQLite for PostgreSQL without changing business logic
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries and single responsibilities
- **Algorithm Preservation**: Critical selection/assignment algorithms isolated and preserved

📖 **Learn more:** [Developer Guide - Clean Architecture](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#clean-architecture-overview)

## The Assignment Pipeline

After every user input (registration or availability update), JAWS runs this pipeline:

1. **Selection Phase**: Rank and select available boats/crews using multi-dimensional criteria
2. **Consolidation Phase**: Form selected entities into a structured "flotilla"
3. **Assignment Optimization**: For the next event, perform constraint-based crew swapping
4. **Persistence**: Save updated data and flotilla assignments
5. **Output Generation**: Render tables and generate calendar files

**Key Insight:** The system uses deterministic shuffling (seeded by `crc32($eventId)`) to ensure the same inputs always produce identical assignments.

Developed for Nepean Sailing Club's Social Day Cruising Program.

Refactored to Clean Architecture in 2026, preserving all original business logic while improving maintainability, testability, and flexibility.

---

**Project History:** The original codebase has been preserved in the `legacy/` folder. The refactoring to Clean Architecture maintained identical behavior for all critical algorithms (Selection, Assignment, Ranking) while modernizing the codebase structure.
